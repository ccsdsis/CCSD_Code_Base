<h2><strong>Student Behavior Forms</strong></h2>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The behavior forms listed to the left are the available forms that you can produce based on existing behavior events. Each form has a custom screen that enables you to populate the form before saving and/or printing. Information entered onto the forms, through your web browser, does not save onto the database. Do not navigate away from a form page unless you are completely finished filling out, printing, and saving the form. Information typed onto the form is lost when you navigate away. Depending on the form, you must select a behavior event. </p>
<p>You can save the form(s) in Adobe Acrobat PDF or Microsoft Word formats to your desktop or network drive.</p>
<p><strong><em>**The forms are student based; therefore, you can only print forms for the student you are currently viewing for behavior events that occur in the current school year.</em></strong></p>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to use this forms tool, you must use Mozilla Firefox as your web browser and you will need to disable mixed-content blocking. </p>
<p><strong>To disable mixed-content blocking:</strong></p>
<p>1.  In the address bar, type "about:config" and press Enter.  </p>
<p>2.  Click the "I'll be careful, I promise!" button.  </p>
<p>3.  In the search field, type "block_active".  </p>
<p>4.  Set the value for the one search result  ("security.mixed_content.block_active_content") to "false".</p>
<p><em><strong>For assistance with Mozilla Firefox, please contact the User Support Services Helpdesk at (702) 799-3300</strong></em></p>
<p>The forms also require Adobe Acrobat and/or Microsoft Word.</p>
